# OpenCPB: Open Computing Platform for Bioinformatics

## Background

Bioinformatics is one of the areas that have been rapidly advancing
and require a large amount of computing resources and storage
resources
(e.g.,[Genomics in the Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/health/genomics/),
[Google Genomics](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/)).
We see many startup companies (e.g.,
[Deep Genomics](https://www.deepgenomics.com/)) and various active
research projects.

On the other hand, the overall software services and infrastructure
have a large room for improvement and sophistication. For example,
[BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/smartblast/?LINK_LOC=BlastHomeLink)
is one of the popular services, but if you submit a simple search
query, it can easily take more than one minute to get a result. This
can be faster.


## Objective

The goal of the project is to build an open computing platform for
Bioinformatics based on various modern technologies. Our initial focus
is to build a storage engine specialized for processing large-scale
genome data efficiently.
